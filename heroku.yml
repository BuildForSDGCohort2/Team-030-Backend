setup:

  - plan: mongodb # Provision a mongodb addon at runtime I guess!
    as: DATABASE
 config:
  DB_URL: # Provision a DB_URL config variable at runtime. It is probable that setting up a mongodb addon would provision a database url for use. If that is the case, you may remove this one. But read up the docs first and be sure, please!.
build:
 docker:
  web: Dockerfile # Use Dockerfile in project root to build app on Heroku.
